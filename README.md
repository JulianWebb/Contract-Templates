# Contract-Templates (US only)

Simply download the contracts and fill in all the highlighted portions. I use Adobe Sign to add signature fields and send contracts to be e-signed. You print the Word document to a PDF and load that PDF into a new contract in Adobe Sign; then, at the bottom, you add a signature field, a name field and a title field. When the Client opens the email they will be directed to sign and add their name and title where you specified. Boom, contract signed and it's saved in your account.

DISCLAIMER: This contract was written by my business contract lawyer, by downloading my contracts you are waiving the right to hold me or my lawyer liable for anything you do with it and what might come from it. You are free to use these contracts and modify them to fit your businesses.

One contract has slightly different wording for monthly subscription Clients, and the other is for Clients who pay you a lump sum with no monthly commitment. But you can add hosting fees, domain registration fees, or anything else you need to the contract. Make sure you put all your fees and everything in your contract as a supplement to what I have provided.

Make sure you replace the highlighted text with yours and your Clients' info and pricing.
